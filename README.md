# 📈 Cryptocurrency Data Analysis
This repository contains a simple data scraping and analysis project for cryptocurrencies. The project collects data from the CoinMarketCap API for the 15 best-performing cryptocurrencies and analyzes their price changes over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository to your local machine and run the main.py file to start collecting data from the API. The data will be saved in a CSV file in the repository.

## 📊 Data Analysis
The project analyzes the collected data using the pandas and seaborn libraries in Python. It calculates the average price change percentage for each cryptocurrency over different time periods (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days) and plots the results using a point plot. The project also generates line plots for the price changes of 15 selected cryptocurrencies over time.

## 🤔 Insights
From the data analysis, we can observe the following insights:

Bitcoin has the highest price among all the cryptocurrencies analyzed.
The average price change percentage for all cryptocurrencies over the 90-day period is negative, indicating a bearish market trend.
Dogecoin has the highest average price change percentage over the 1-hour period, indicating high volatility.
